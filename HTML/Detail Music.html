          <p>
            Chasing a heart is like chasing a ghost
            You can't make somebody you love feel the same
            If they don't
            It doesn't matter the words that you say
            'Cause just like the seasons, you can't stop the way
            People change
            I'd drive through the night
            Walk a thousand miles
            To feel your head on my chest
            I'd give anything
            That's what's killing me
            'Cause you won't even reach across the bed
            The silence is getting too cold
            We stopped fighting
            'Cause deep down inside, we both know
            Just for once, what do you want? Baby, tell me the truth
            Do you only love me 'cause you have to?
            All of your friends now were all of mine first
            Your mom and your dad they were both there for me
            When mine weren't
            I can't see tomorrow without you today
            But I'd rather let you go
            Than make you feel like you've gotta stay
            I'd drive through the night
            Walk a thousand miles
            To feel your head on my chest
            I'd give anything
            That's what's killing me
            'Cause you won't even reach across the bed
            The silence is getting too cold
            We stopped fighting
            'Cause deep down inside, we both know
            Just for once, what do you want? Baby, tell me the truth
            Do you only love me 'cause you have to?
            So come on, don't be afraid to break my heart
            It only gets worse if you wait
            Just for once, what do you want? Baby, tell me the truth
            Do you only love me 'cause you have to?
            I'm so sorry, I wish I could be
            The one to love you more
            I hope you find somebody
            Who's got everything you're searching for
            The silence is getting too cold
            We stopped fighting
            'Cause deep down inside, we both know
            Just for once, what do you want? Baby, tell me the truth
            Do you only love me 'cause you have to?
